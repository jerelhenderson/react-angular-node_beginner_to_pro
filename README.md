# React, Angular, Node In-Depth Guide: Beginner to Pro (2018 Edition)
This repository contains a collection of mini-projects + a complete web application developed with Angular2.
The projects follow the Udemy course [React, Angular, Node In-Depth Guide: Beginner to Pro (2018)](https://www.udemy.com/course/practical-angular-react-node-airbnb-style-application/).

## Bare Necessities
In order to check these projects out, you will need...
1. ...a computer ü•Å
1. ...to install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org)
1. ...to install [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local)
1. ...a [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com) account and database server 

## Up and Running
Now that you have installed the prerequisites, loading the projects should also be a cinch!
1. Install project dependencies from project root directory using `npm install`
1. Run the development server using `npm start`, open a new tab and navigate to `http://localhost:4200` (<a href="http://localhost:4200" target="_blank">or click here</a>)
1. As mentioned before, if you'd like to update a database, you'll need to create/login to a MongoDB account and create one. Setting up a database to interface with this web app is a bit beyond the scope of this README, but one day I may come back and provide some instructions.
